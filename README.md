cucumber-jvm-parallel-template
=======================

CucumberJVM template project for running tests in parallel. Two options how to run:
 1. One "Runner" class per thread (use profile `parallel`). By "Runner" class is meant *RunCukesCheeseTest* class in this example.
    * **NOTE** - in order to use this approach, you will need to create separate "runner" class per one thread. Tests belonging to one "runner" class will be executed sequentially.
    * More on this read [here](https://opencredo.com/running-cucumber-jvm-tests-in-parallel/).
 2. Using [cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin](https://github.com/temyers/cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin) (use profile `parallelPlugin`)
    * *cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin* will automatically generates "runner" classes.

### Command for execution
```
mvn clean verify -P [singleThreaded,nogrid,grid,parallel,parallelPlugin]
```

* *singleThreaded* - execute tests sequentially, omits parallel execution
* *nogrid* - execute tests locally
* *grid* - execute tests on Selenium Grid. Grid Hub can be set in pom in `seleniumGridURL` property
* Thread count can be set via `-Dthreads` argument

For example, invoking 
```
mvn clean verify -P parallelPlugin,nogrid -Dthreads=3 -Dbrowser=chrome
``` 
will execute tests in parallel 3 threads on local machine and using *cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin* plugin. In addition, `-Dbrowser` setting will set browser to Chrome.
